# 4. Practice Problems: OOP and Encapsulation

1. In your own words, what is Object Oriented Programming? 
	* Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a **programming paradigm** in which programs are viewed in terms of objects. In OOP, the objects interact with each other. In short, Programs in OOP are "**a set of objects with state and behavior**".

2. Describe some advantages and disadvantages of OOP.
	* Advantages of OOP
		* It helps in code organization. 
		* OOP makes the code flexible, easy to understand, easy to change and reduce dependencies in large codebases. 
		* OOP lets programmers focus attention on specific parts of the code without worrying about the dependencies in the rest of the programs. 

	* Disadvantages of OOP 
		* OOP doesn't always lead to more efficient code. In some cases it can lead to less efficient code; OOP programs can require more memory, more disk space, and more computing power. 
		* OOP programs are often larger than the equivalent procedural program.

3. In your own words, what does encapsulation refer to in JavaScript?
	* Encapsulation describes an idea of combining/bundling state(data) and behaviors(operations/functions/methods) to form an entity/object.
	* For instance a simple banking application, involves account details, user details and different operations such as withdrawal of funds from the account, depositing funds into the account, etc. 

4. In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?
	* In most OOP languages, encapsulation has a broader application. It also refers to restricting access to certain state and behaviors using **private access modifiers**. That is, the other objects can access the data and the methods through **public interface/public access modifier** only using **getter/setter** methods. 
	* Unfortunately, JavaScript doesn't have access modifiers (such as private, default, or protected). There are ways to achieve a degree of access restrictions, but they're not perfect.
