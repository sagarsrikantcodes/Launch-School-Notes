# 2.What is OOP?

* OOP is a style of programming that uses objects to organize a program. 
* Object-Oriented Programming is a **programming paradigm** in which we think about a problem in terms of objects. We think about a program in terms of collection of objects that interact with each other. 
* The idea is to model a program based on how objects in the real world interact. 
* A real-world object like a car, for example, has **state** -- properties -- like color, number of doors and fuel-level amongst others. It also has **behavior**; it can be started, steered, or parked. In short, problems in OOP are "**_a set of objects with state and behavior_**".
* Why is this radically different approach of organizing code?
	* One of the challenging aspects of software engineering is organizing code so that it's easy for programmers to reason about and easy to maintain. Object-Oriented Programming helps with that.
	* OOP makes the code flexible, easy to understand, easy to change and reduce dependencies in large, complex programs. 
	* OOP lets programmers focus attention on specific parts of the code without worrying about dependencies in the rest of the program. 

* OOP also doesn't always lead to more efficient code. In some cases it can also lead to less efficient code; OOP programs can require more memory, more disk space, and more computing power. However, the advantages of OOP usually outweigh these concerns.
