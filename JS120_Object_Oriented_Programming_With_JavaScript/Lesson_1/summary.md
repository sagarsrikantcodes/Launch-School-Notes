# Summary

* Encapsulation is the idea of bundling data and operations related to that data in a cohesive unit called an object. In OOP, encapsulation also refers to the idea of restricting access to state and some behavior, but JavaScript objects don't support that type of encapsulation. 

* The simplest way to create a JavaScript object is to use the object literal syntax: a pair of opening and closing curly braces. Adding methods to an objects is as simple as adding a function as the value of a property. 

* We can access the properties and methods of an object from within a method using the `this` keyword. 

* Objects collaborate with other objects by using them as part of their state. We say that two objects have a collaborator relationship if one of them is part of the state of the other. 

* One way to automate the creation of objects is to use the factory function pattern. A factory function returns an object with a particular set of methods and properties. The methods remain the same across the objects, while the property values can be customized by providing them as arguments.

* One object factory can reuse another object factory by mixing the object returned by another factory function into itself by using `Object.assign`.
