## Object Creation Patterns

* Constructors
* Constructors with prototypes
* Constructors as functions and the prototype property
* Static and instance Properties and Methods
* Built-in Constructors
* ES6 Classes

1. Review of the object factory pattern for creating objects. 

2. Unlike other mainstream languages, JavaScript doesn't implement behavior sharing using class-based inheritance even though ES6 introduced the `class` keyword to the language. Instead, it uses the object prototype to share properties. 

3. The above distinction is crucial to understanding how JavaScript generates individual objects; it forms the basis of all object-creation patterns in JavaScript that feature behavior sharing.

4. Look at different ways to generate individual objects and explore object prototypes.

5. Two ways to create objects in an object-oriented pattern - one which simulates a classical approach and another that uses the `class` syntax. 

6. Type of thinking required is Prototype-based object-orientation.
